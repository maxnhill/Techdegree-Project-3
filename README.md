# Techdegree-Project-3

This code defines a Hangman game that uses phrases as the words to be guessed. The game starts by displaying a welcome message, explaining the rules, and selecting a random phrase from a list. The player then guesses letters to complete the phrase, and the game continues until the player correctly guesses the phrase or exceeds the maximum number of incorrect guesses. The player can choose to play again or exit the game.
